# Eminigma

This project aims to simulate the Enigma Hardware. Reuse is permitted on condition of fair attribution. It would be great to have all Enigma Models supported, but that's only possible as far as there are credible sources for the internal wiring.

### Prerequisites

The Python programming language.

### Supported Models

- Enigma I
- Enigma M3
- Enigma M4
